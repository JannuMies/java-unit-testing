<h1>Why TDD</h1>
<p>
Whenever people consider programming and writing unit tests separate things,
I start yearning for a drink and a shoulder to cry against. If any
non-trivial piece of code does not have a test, how can you say that
it works? How can you safely change parts of it, if you see that your design
will not work? How can you justify to yourself that
<a href="http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Testing_Is_the_Engineering_Rigor_of_Software_Development">
you have built something without validating it?</a>
</p>

<p>
Testing a functionality can be done manually, but if I change some
functionality in a module that is reachable by 17 paths, can accept
4 parameters and has 3 possible exits, I check two of the 204 possible
permutations and then start browsing the web. A good tester will
check them all, but I wouldn't want to misuse the time of a
good tester by forcing one to check 204 things more than once.
Or Crom forbid, if I would need to add additional paths to the
forementioned functionality. I'd be afraid to tell the testers,
that I've just added another 12 things to their daily grind.
</p>

<p>
When I have a repeatable validation procedure for my code, I can
actually show what parts of my code work properly. This gives me
the power to wantonly muck about the code and bend it wildly when
I'm writing. I can think of only what I'm doing right now, without
worrying if something I did 15 minutes ago will break. Because
if something breaks, I will notice it the next time I run the tests,
which in TDD happens constantly.
