<h1>KISS</h1>
<p>
A couple of good programmers I know have desktop backgrounds that read
"Keep it simple, stupid". It's a very good mantra, when writing code.
My way of combining
<a href="http://phraseologyproject.com/phrase/keep-it-simple-stupid">KISS</a>
and
<a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html">SRP</a>
in writing unit tests has been to mock every dependancy, thereby cutting
down the cumulative multiplexity of different layers. Consider the
following:
</p>
<code>
void updateTree(Tree treeToUpdate) {
  if(gardenValidator.isValid(treeToUpdate) {
    return garden.update(treeToUpdate);
  } else {
    throw new InvalidTreeException(treeToUpdate);
  }
}
</code>

<p>
In this block, I am interested of only two things: A) If the tree is valid,
it is passed to garden.update. B) If the tree is invalid, an exception is
thrown. This means two tests. In this block the responsibility of validation
is singled out, so I don't want to write different tests for all
possible ways it can fail a validation, because that is the job for
the tests testing GardenValidator.
