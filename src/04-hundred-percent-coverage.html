<h1>100% coverage</h1>
<p>
If someone tries to push for 100% test coverage,
I get a knee jerk reaction. Not because it can't be done, but because the
person requesting it probably does not understand what should be tested
with unit tests and what are the benefits if unit tests. A 100% test
coverage for a DTO-class, that is literally nothing else than a bunch
of fields, getters, and setters, with zero logic, it is just time consuming.
A test for a complex service, with multiple interaction points, on the
other hand is clearly an entity that should have 100% test coverage.
</p>

<p>
It is also very important to remember, that a 100% test coverage can
be accomplished in many ways. Analysis packages like
<a href="http://www.sonarcube.org">Sonarqube</a>
can use multiple plugins to check that all possible code branches are passed
when running a test file, but none of these tools can actually tell
if the tests check for anything sensible. A 100% test coverage sounds nice,
but if the tests don't fail when a change causes the code to work in a
non-intended way, they are useless.
</p>

<p>
There are also places where I find it simpler to write integration tests to
ensure the correct behaviour of the program, than to write unit tests.
For example, writing a unit test to verify the complete pipeline through
a REST-api to the database and back again usually requires you to
set up the database in a way that you can start the REST-service on it.
After that you have to start the REST-service and then you have to execute the possible login-stuff for every test. After that, you might even need to
execute the tests in a specific order, which goes quite far from
what the intention of some well known unit testing tools
<a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#tests_2">
actually are.</a>
</p>

<p>
I feel that the situation described in the previous example is something
that should be prevented before the project actually starts. Unit testing
and integration testing are two very different beasts in my book, and
while they are both something a large scale project needs, they should be
used for their specific purposes.
