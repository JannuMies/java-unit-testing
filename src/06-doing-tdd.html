<h1>Doing TDD</h1>
<p>
I learned TDD by doing pair coding with patient people who showed me the
ropes. If you don't have access to a mentor, a good way to learn is practice.
</p>

<p>
For instance, use 20 minutes on a single
<a href="http://content.codersdojo.org/code-kata-catalogue/">
like these</a> and repeat it every day of the week. Then
switch to another for the next week. It's not important if you can't
finish it in the 20 minutes, because you're going to do it again
from the start the next day. The problem is only important if you are
practicing algorithm solving, but since this should be an exercise in
doing TDD, the only thing important is that you write it test-first.
