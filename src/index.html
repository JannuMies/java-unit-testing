<h1>Java unit testing as I've done it for a while</h1>
<p>
My boss and project lead wanted to write something about unit testing
for the job, but bugger that. I'll do it on my own time and reap all the
rewards for this thing.
</p>

<p>
This is a short piece about my opinions on how I think that Java unit
testing should be done. Not a complex piece about complete systems
testing, test automation or any of that jazz.
